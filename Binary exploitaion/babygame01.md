##Description
Get the flag and reach the exit.
Welcome to BabyGame! Navigate around the map and see what you can find! The game is available to download here.
There is no source available, so you'll have to figure your way around the map.
You can connect with it using nc saturn.picoctf.net 55735.

## Approach
download
```py
$ file game
game: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=02a3bb43121b1f6fbc2ab9154ab38a9427e19149, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
it is a ELF 32-bit LSB executable file
               
i opened it in an online decompiler `gidra`
got a long code...
```py
if (local_aa4 != '\0') {
    puts("flage");
    win();
    fflush(_stdout);
  }
  ```
opened the terminal and used `nc saturn.picoctf.net 55735`<br>

use `W` `A` `S` `D` to move around<br>
I got `@` to x and it said `you win`, but there was no flag<br>
then I getting `@` out of grid<br> 
and it said u win<br>

i checked online and got to know that all the commands start from   [0,0]<br>
so i searched for the flag behind {0,0}
and I got the flag at {-4,0}, i.e 4 steps behind {0,0}

and I noticed that if enter p at anyplace(most places) in the map<br>
it says you win!!

anyway the flag is `picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabled_2682e995}`
