there is search option and a home button which redirects us to the search<br>
first i tried searching for `snickerdoodle` which is suggested in the search box<br>

i used `crtl+shift+c` to inspect the elements of the page<br>
then i went to `Application` and `http://mercury.picoctf.net:64944` under `cookies`<br>

it says select a cookie to preview its value

when i search for `snickerdoodle` the value turns ``0``<br>

if i search for anything random then the value turns `-1`<br>
So I tried increasing the values and it showed names of various cookies<br>
like on putting value 10:

so kept on inreasing the value to find the flag at some value<br>
i was thinking to write a code to find the value....

but at 18 i got the flag
